# Muller-Brown Experiments
This directory contains the code to reproduce results on the 2D Muller-Brown (MB) potential

- TODO

The code is organized in a series of Jupyter notebooks (all other files contain utilities called by these notebooks):

- ```mb_analytical.ipynb```: Uses the analytical MB force field with OM optimization to find transition paths. Also used to generate data for training generative models. 
- ```mb_diffusion.ipynb```: Trains a denoising diffusion model on samples from 2DMB and performs various flavors of OM optimization. Also used generated data for estimating committor function and rates.
- ```mb_flowmatch.ipynb```: Trains a flow matching model on samples from 2DMB and performs various flavors of OM optimization. 
- ```mb_committor_rates.ipynb```: Trains a MLP to estimate the committor function, from which reaction rates are computed using the Backward Kolmogorov Equation (BKE) formalism.
